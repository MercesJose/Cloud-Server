# Cloud-Server
The Cloud-Server project is a mini PC that allows users to implement their own private cloud using ownCloud. This project is a free alternative to the various cloud-based services that already exist and provides a file manager, support for music sharing, streaming, calendar, contacts and much more... all this on our own computer in question that based on Compute Module 4 IO Board together with Compute Module 4.

It is also possible to develop small webservices for the cloud.
Here I provide all necessary documentation for the manufacture and assembly of PCBs and also all SolidWorks drawings of the case.
The project is completely open and will bear much fruit, especially as it is low-cost.
